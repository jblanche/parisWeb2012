PoC as seen on my talk @tapeup (http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/18455566)

No time for further explainations. Code talks for itself.

Kudos to atduskgreg for his skelestreamer (https://github.com/atduskgreg/Skelestreamer)! It's basiclly a simpleopenni->json (via tcp) streamer written for processing.org)

Have fun!
